### Hi there,  I am Sefika 👋
---
I have just graduated from Data Science master program of the University of Potsdam. Before that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Ege University in 2015.
I also worked as a software engineer in Istanbul after graduation.
My interests are robotics, adversarial training, robustness, cognitive science, knowledge graphs, and ontology engineering(:green_heart:) :)

🔭 I’m currently looking for a PhD position.

🌱 I’m currently learning Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs.
