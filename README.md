### Hi there,  I am Sefika ðŸ‘‹
---

I graduated from Data Science master program of the University of Potsdam and have started to pursue PhD under Corporate Semantic Web Group of Freie Universitaet Berlin. Before that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Ege University in 2015.
I also worked as a software engineer in Istanbul after graduation.
My interests are robotics, adversarial training, robustness, cognitive science, knowledge graphs, and ontology engineering(:green_heart:) :)


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs.

ðŸ¤“ My current project is a NER model for [corona news](https://github.com/sefeoglu/coronanews-ner).
