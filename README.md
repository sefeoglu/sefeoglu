I graduated from Data Science master program of the University of Potsdam and have started to pursue PhD under the Corporate Semantic Web Group of Freie Universitaet Berlin.
My interests are continual learning,  adversarial training, robustness, cognitive science, knowledge graphs,
and ontology engineering (ðŸ’š)


*  ðŸŽ‰ A book chapter about Hybrid AI for Healthcare is online now!


ðŸŒ± I submitted a journal paper "Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based Relation Extraction" to Semantic Web Journal in March 2024. Its revised version is [here](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj3810.pdf)
