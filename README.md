### Hi there, I am Åžefika ðŸ‘‹
---

I have started to work as a research asistant under the open distributed systems research group at the TU Berlin. I graduated from Data Science master program of the University of Potsdam and have started to pursue PhD under Corporate Semantic Web Group of Freie Universitaet Berlin. Before that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Ege University in 2015.
My interests are robotics, adversarial training, robustness, cognitive science, knowledge graphs,
and ontology engineering(:green_heart:) :)

* An ontology matching part of my master thesis (GraphMatcher) has obtained the highest F1-measure in uncertain reference alignments of the OAEI-2022 conference track among all experts. My tool will be at the competition in 2023 ðŸ¤“ 

* My current project is a NER model for [corona news](https://github.com/sefeoglu/coronanews-ner). Its paper has been accepted by the SWAT4HCLS 2023.

*  ðŸŽ‰ A book chapter about Hybrid AI for Healthcare will be online soon!

ðŸŒ± I have been working on relation extraction for streaming data (corpus).
