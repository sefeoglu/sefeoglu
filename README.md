### Hi there,  I am Sefika ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science master's student at University of Potsdam. Before that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Ege University in 2015.
I also worked as a software engineer in Istanbul after graduation.
My interests are robotics, adversarial training, robustness, cognitive science, knowledge graphs, and ontology engineering(:green_heart:) :)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Automated Ontology Construction.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  meta-learning and graph representation learning.
