### Hi there, I am Åžefika ðŸ‘‹

I have started to work as a research asistant under the Open Distributed Systems (ODS) research group at the TU Berlin. I graduated from Data Science master program of the University of Potsdam and have started to pursue PhD under the Corporate Semantic Web Group of Freie Universitaet Berlin.
My interests are robotics, adversarial training, robustness, cognitive science, knowledge graphs,
and ontology engineering(:green_heart:) :)

* An ontology matching part of my master thesis (GraphMatcher) has obtained the highest F1-measure in uncertain reference alignments of the OAEI-2022 conference track among all experts. My tool will be at the competition in 2023 ðŸ¤“ 

* My NER model for [corona news](https://github.com/sefeoglu/coronanews-ner). Its paper was presented  at SWAT4HCLS in Frebruary 2023 in Basel.

*  ðŸŽ‰ A book chapter about Hybrid AI for Healthcare will be online soon!

*  ðŸŽ‰ My team "Gryffindor" was awarded with the Best Scientific Research Report at the ISWS 2023, and our [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=a1NBH3exoH) was accepted by the Wikidata Workshop under the ISWC 2023. We are still working on its further version.


ðŸŒ± I have been working on relation extraction for streaming (corpus) data.

ðŸŒ± I am currently working on construction biocatalysts ontology, especially enzyme ðŸ¤“

Note: Please pointing out the repositories in case you would like to use any piece of my code lines! ThanksðŸ™‚
